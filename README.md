## Displaying air quality info. and Detecting intrusions system using Raspberry Pi 


### What
  1. Displaying air quality information based on location address using IP Address
  2. Detecting intrusions using Ultrasonic sensor and Sending Email to User
***
### How
  - Displaying air quality information
    1. Get IP Address of Raspberry Pi
    2. Find location address using WHOIS OpenAPI and Naver Maps API
    3. Inquire Air quality information using location address by Open API that provided government
    4. If moving is detected using Ultrasonic sensor, LED turns on according to the air quality
        - If air quality is good, LED turn on Blue
        - If air quality is normal, LED turn on Green
        - If air quality is bad, LED turn on Yellow
        - If air quality is too bad, LED turn on Red
        
  - Detecting intrusions
    1. If moving is detected using Ultrasonic sensor,
    2. LED turn on Red and is blinking
    3. Send Email to user
    
  - Changing mode
    + If press button during 2 sec, change the mode
    + Home mode is to provide air quality information
    + Detect mode is to detect intrusion and send Email to user
